<blockquote>
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), aimed at reducing the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, have dramatically influenced our everyday behaviour. In this work, we study how individuals adapted their daily movements and person-to-person contact patterns over time in response to the NPIs. We leverage longitudinal GPS mobility data of hundreds of thousands of anonymous individuals to empirically show and quantify the dramatic disruption in people’s mobility habits and social behaviour. We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines, also reducing person-to-person contacts. Moreover, we find that the individual patterns of visits are influenced by the strength of the NPIs policies, the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people’s mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions. Finally, despite the gradual recovery in visit patterns, we find that individuals continue to keep person-to-person contacts low. This apparent conflict hints that the evolution of policy adherence should be carefully addressed by policymakers, epidemiologists and mobility experts.

</summary>

<blockquote>
In January 2021, retail investors coordinated on Reddit to target short selling activity by hedge funds on GameStop shares, causing a surge in the share price and triggering significant losses for the funds involved. Such an effective collective action was unprecedented in finance, and its dynamics remain unclear. Here, we analyse Reddit and financial data and rationalise the events based on recent findings describing how a small fraction of committed individuals may trigger behavioural cascades. First, we operationalise the concept of individual commitment in financial discussions. Second, we show that the increase of commitment within Reddit predated the initial surge in price. Third, we reveal that initial committed users occupied a central position in the network of Reddit conversations. Finally, we show that the social identity of the broader Reddit community grew as the collective action unfolded. These findings shed light on financial collective action, as several observers anticipate it will grow in importance.

</summary>

<small>

<blockquote>
The inference of novel knowledge, the discovery of hidden patterns, and the uncovering of insights from large amounts of data from a multitude of sources make Data Science (DS) to an art rather than just a mere scientific discipline. The study and design of mathematical models able to analyze information represents a central research topic in DS. In this work, we introduce and investigate a novel model for influence maximization (IM) on graphs using ideas from kernel-based approximation, Gaussian process regression, and the minimization of a corresponding variance term. Data-driven approaches can be applied to determine proper kernels for this IM model and machine learning methodologies are adopted to tune the model parameters. Compared to stochastic models in this field that rely on costly Monte-Carlo simulations, our model allows for a simple and cost-efficient update strategy to compute optimal influencing nodes on a graph. In several numerical experiments, we show the properties and benefits of this new model.

</summary>

<small>

<blockquote>
Kernel based methods yield approximation models that are flexible, efficient and powerful. In particular, they utilize fixed feature maps of the data, being often associated to strong analytical results that prove their accuracy. On the other hand, the recent success of machine learning methods has been driven by deep neural networks (NNs). They achieve a significant accuracy on very high-dimensional data, in that they are able to learn also efficient data representations or data-based feature maps. In this paper, we leverage a recent deep kernel representer theorem to connect the two approaches and understand their interplay. In particular, we show that the use of special types of kernels yield models reminiscent of neural networks that are founded in the same theoretical framework of classical kernel methods, while enjoying many computational properties of deep neural networks. Especially the introduced Structured Deep Kernel Networks (SDKNs) can be viewed as neural networks with optimizable activation functions obeying a representer theorem. Analytic properties show their universal approximation properties in different asymptotic regimes of unbounded number of centers, width and depth. Especially in the case of unbounded depth, the constructions is asymptotically better than corresponding constructions for ReLU neural networks, which is made possible by the flexibility of kernel approximation.

<i>Measuring close proximity  interactions in summer camps during the COVID-19 pandemic</i> (2021). <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14750'> <i class="fa fa-file-pdf"></i> Preprint </a>
</summary>

<small>

<blockquote>
Policy makers have implemented multiple non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 worldwide crisis. Interventions had the aim of reducing close proximity interactions, which drive the spread of the disease. A deeper knowledge of human physical interactions has revealed necessary, especially in all settings involving children, whose education and gathering activities should be preserved.  Despite their relevance,  almost  no  data  are  available on close proximity  contacts among  children  in  schools  or  other  educational  settings during the pandemic. Contact data are usually gathered via Bluetooth, which nonetheless  offers  a  low  temporal  and  spatial  resolution. Recently, ultra-wideband (UWB) radios emerged as a more accurate alternative that nonetheless exhibits a significantly higher energy consumption, limiting  in-field  studies. In this paper, we leverage a novel approach,embodied by the Janus system that combines these radios by exploiting their complementary benefits.  The very accurate proximity data gathered in-field by Janus, once augmented with several metadata, unlocks unprecedented levels of information, enabling the development of novel multi-level risk analyses. By means of this technology, we have collected real contact data of children and educators in three summer camps during summer 2020in the province of Trento, Italy.  The wide variety of performed daily activities induced multiple individual behaviors, allowing a rich investigation  of  social  environments  from  the  contagion  risk  perspective. We  consider  risk  based  on  duration  and  proximity  of  contacts  and classify  interactions  according  to  different  risk  levels. We can then evaluate the summer camps’ organization,  observe the effect of partition in small groups,  or social bubbles,  and identify the organized activities that mitigate the riskier behaviors. Overall, we offer an insight into the educator-child and child-child social interactions  during  the  pandemic,  thus  providing  a  valuable tool  for  schools,  summer  camps,  and  policy makers to  (re)structure educational activities safely.

</summary>

<small>

<blockquote>
Data-dependent greedy algorithms in kernel spaces are known to provide fast converging interpolants, while being extremely easy to implement and efficient to run. Despite this experimental evidence, no detailed theory has yet been presented. This situation is unsatisfactory especially when compared to the case of the data-independent P-greedy algorithm, for which optimal convergence rates are available, despite its performances being usually inferior to the ones of target data-dependent algorithms. In this work we fill this gap by first defining a new scale of greedy algorithms for interpolation that comprises all the existing ones in a unique analysis, where the degree of dependency of the selection criterion on the functional data is quantified by a real parameter. We then prove new convergence rates where this degree is taken into account and we show that, possibly up to a logarithmic factor, target data-dependent selection strategies provide faster convergence. In particular, for the first time we obtain convergence rates for target data adaptive interpolation that are faster than the ones given by uniform points, without the need of any special assumption on the target function. The rates are confirmed by a number of examples. These results are made possible by a new analysis of greedy algorithms in general Hilbert spaces.

</summary>

<small>

<blockquote>
Semi-lagrangian schemes for discretization of the dynamic programming principle are based on a time discretization projected on a state-space grid. The use of a structured grid makes this approach not feasible for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. Here, we present a new approach for infinite horizon optimal control problems where the value function is computed using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) by the Shepard's moving least squares approximation method on scattered grids. We propose a new method to generate a scattered mesh driven by the dynamics and the selection of the shape parameter in the RBF using an optimization routine. This mesh will help to localize the problem and approximate the dynamic programming principle in high dimension. Error estimates for the value function are also provided. Numerical tests for high dimensional problems will show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<i>Convergence results in image interpolation with the continuous SSIM</i> (2021). <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03879'> <i class="fa fa-file-pdf"></i> Preprint </a>
</summary>

<small>

<blockquote>
Assessing the similarity of two images is a complex task that has attracted significant efforts in the image processing community. The widely used Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) addresses this problem by quantifying a perceptual structural similarity.  In this paper we consider a recently introduced continuous SSIM (cSSIM), which allows one to analyze sequences of images of increasingly fine resolutions. We prove that this index includes the classical SSIM as a special case, and we provide a precise connection between image similarity measured by the cSSIM and by the $L_2$ norm.  Using this connection, we derive bounds on the cSSIM by means of bounds on the $L_2$ error, and we even prove that the two error measures are equivalent in certain circumstances. We exploit these results to obtain precise rates of convergence with respect to the cSSIM for several concrete image interpolation methods, and we further validate these findings by many numerical experiments.  This newly established connection paves the way to obtain novel insights into the features and limitations of the SSIM.

<blockquote>
Temporal graphs are structures which model relational data between entities that change over time. Due to the complex structure of data, mining statistically significant temporal subgraphs, also known as temporal motifs, is a challenging task. In this work, we present an efficient technique for extracting temporal motifs in temporal networks. Our method is based on the novel notion of egocentric temporal neighborhoods, namely multi-layer structures centered on an ego node. Each temporal layer of the structure consists of the first-order neighborhood of the ego node, and corresponding nodes in sequential layers are connected by an edge. The strength of this approach lies in the possibility of encoding these structures into a unique bit vector, thus bypassing the problem of graph isomorphism in searching for temporal motifs. This allows our algorithm to mine substantially larger motifs with respect to alternative approaches. Furthermore, by bringing the focus on the temporal dynamics of the interactions of a specific node, our model allows to mine temporal motifs which are visibly interpretable. Experiments on a number of complex networks of social interactions confirm the advantage of the proposed approach over alternative non-egocentric solutions. The egocentric procedure is indeed more efficient in revealing similarities and discrepancies among different social environments, independently of the different technologies used to collect data, which instead affect standard non-egocentric measures.

We extend the SDKN to combine it with standard machine learning modules and compare it with Neural Networks on the scientific challenge of data-driven prediction of closure terms of turbulent flows. We show experimentally that the SDKNs are capable of dealing with large datasets and achieve near-perfect accuracy on the given application.

<blockquote>
 Statistics on migration flows are often derived from census data, which suffer from intrinsic limitations, including costs and infrequent sampling. When censuses are used, there is typically a time gap - up to a few years - between the data collection process and the computation and publication of relevant statistics. This gap is a significant drawback for the analysis of a phenomenon that is continuously and rapidly changing. Alternative data sources, such as surveys and field observations, also suffer from reliability, costs, and scale limitations. The ubiquity of mobile phones enables an accurate and efficient collection of up-to-date data related to migration. Indeed, passively collected data by the mobile network infrastructure via aggregated, pseudonymized Call Detail Records (CDRs) is of great value to understand human migrations. Through the analysis of mobile phone data, we can shed light on the mobility patterns of migrants, detect spontaneous settlements and understand the daily habits, levels of integration, and human connections of such vulnerable social groups. This Chapter discusses the importance of leveraging mobile phone data as an alternative data source to gather precious and previously unavailable insights on various aspects of migration. Also, we highlight pending challenges that would need to be addressed before we can effectively benefit from the availability of mobile phone data to help make better decisions that would ultimately improve millions of people's lives.

Existing surveys focus on single tasks, data sources, mechanistic or traditional machine learning approaches, while a comprehensive description of deep learning solutions is missing. This survey provides a taxonomy of mobility tasks, a discussion on the challenges related to each task and how deep learning may overcome the limitations of traditional models, a description of the most relevant solutions to the mobility tasks described above and the relevant challenges for the future.

<blockquote>
Kernel based methods provide a way to reconstruct potentially high-dimensional functions from meshfree samples, i.e., sampling points and corresponding target values. A crucial ingredient for this to be successful is the distribution of the sampling points. Since the computation of an optimal selection of sampling points may be an infeasible task, one promising option is to use greedy methods.  Although these methods may be very effective, depending on the specific greedy criterion the chosen points might quickly lead to instabilities in the computation. To circumvent this problem, we introduce and investigate a new class of stabilized greedy kernel algorithms, which can be used to create a scale of new selection strategies.  We analyze these algorithms, and in particular we prove convergence results and quantify in a precise way the distribution of the selected points. These results allow to prove, in the case of certain Sobolev kernels, that the algorithms have optimal stability and optimal convergence rates, including for functions outside the native space of the kernel. The results also apply to the case of the usual $P$-greedy algorithm, significantly improving state-of-the-art results available in the literature. Illustrative experiments are presented that support the theoretical findings and show improvements of the stabilized algorithms in terms of accuracy due to improved stability.

<blockquote>
This chapter deals with kernel methods as a special class of techniques for surrogate modeling. Kernel methods have proven to be efficient in machine learning, pattern recognition and signal analysis due to their flexibility, excellent experimental performance and elegant functional analytic background. These data-based techniques provide so called kernel expansions, i.e., linear combinations of kernel functions which are generated from given input-output point samples that may be arbitrarily scattered. In particular, these techniques are meshless, do not require or depend on a grid, hence are less prone to the curse of dimensionality, even for high-dimensional problems. In contrast to projection-based model reduction, we do not necessarily assume a high-dimensional model, but a general function that models input-output behavior within some simulation context. This could be some micro-model in a multiscale-simulation, some submodel in a coupled system, some initialization function for solvers, coefficient function in PDEs, etc. First, kernel surrogates can be useful if the input-output function is expensive to evaluate, e.g. is a result of a finite element simulation. Here, acceleration can be obtained by sparse kernel expansions. Second, if a function is available only via measurements or a few function evaluation samples, kernel approximation techniques can provide function surrogates that allow global evaluation. We present some important kernel approximation techniques, which are kernel interpolation, greedy kernel approximation and support vector regression. Pseudo-code is provided for ease of reproducibility. In order to illustrate the main features, commonalities and differences, we compare these techniques on a real-world application. The experiments clearly indicate the enormous acceleration potential

<blockquote>
The movements of individuals within and among cities influence critical aspects of our society, such as well-being, the spreading of epidemics, and the quality of the environment. When information about mobility flows is not available for a particular region of interest, we must rely on mathematical models to generate them. In this work, we propose Deep Gravity, an effective model to generate flow probabilities that exploits many features (e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover non-linear relationships between those features and mobility flows. Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity achieves a significant increase in performance, especially in densely populated regions of interest, with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. Deep Gravity has good generalization capability, generating realistic flows also for geographic areas for which there is no data availability for training. Finally, we show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features and highlight crucial differences among the three considered countries interpreting the model’s prediction with explainable AI techniques.

This paper introduces Click to Move (C2M), a novel framework for video generation where the user can control the motion of the synthesized video through mouse clicks specifying simple object trajectories of the key objects in the scene. Our model receives as input an initial frame, its corresponding segmentation map and the sparse motion vectors encoding the input provided by the user. It outputs a plausible video sequence starting from the given frame and with a motion that is consistent with user input. Notably, our proposed deep architecture incorporates a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) modelling the movements of all the objects in the scene in a holistic manner and effectively combining the sparse user motion information and image features. Experimental results show that C2M outperforms existing methods on two publicly available datasets, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our GCN framework at modelling object interactions.

<blockquote>
For dynamical systems with a non hyperbolic equilibrium, it is possible to significantly simplify the study of stability by means of the center manifold theory. This theory allows to isolate the complicated asymptotic behavior of the system close to the equilibrium point and to obtain meaningful predictions of its behavior by analyzing a reduced order system on the so-called center manifold. Since the center manifold is usually not known, good approximation methods are important as the center manifold theorem states that the stability properties of the origin of the reduced order system are the same as those of the origin of the full order system. In this work, we establish a data-based version of the center manifold theorem that works by considering an approximation in place of an exact manifold. Also the error between the approximated and the original reduced dynamics are quantified. We then use an apposite data-based kernel method to construct a suitable approximation of the manifold close to the equilibrium, which is compatible with our general error theory. The data are collected by repeated numerical simulation of the full system by means of a high-accuracy solver, which generates sets of discrete trajectories that are then used as a training set. The method is tested on different examples which show promising performance and good accuracy.

<blockquote>
Manipulating images of complex scenes to reconstruct, insert and/or remove specific object instances is a challenging task. Complex scenes contain multiple semantics and objects, which are frequently cluttered or ambiguous, thus hampering the performance of inpainting models. Conventional techniques often rely on structural information such as object contours in multi-stage approaches that generate unreliable results and boundaries. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model to alter a complex urban scene by removing a user-specified portion of the image and coherently inserting a new object (e.g. car or pedestrian) in that scene. Inspired by recent works on image inpainting, our proposed method leverages the semantic segmentation to model the content and structure of the image, and learn the best shape and location of the object to insert. To generate reliable results, we design a new decoder block that combines the semantic segmentation and generation task to guide better the generation of new objects and scenes, which have to be semantically consistent with the image. Our experiments, conducted on two large-scale datasets of urban scenes (Cityscapes and Indian Driving), show that our proposed approach successfully address the problem of semantically-guided inpainting of complex urban scene.

<blockquote>
In recent years there has been a growing interest in analyzing human behavioral data generated by new technologies. One type of digital footprint that is universal across the world, but that has received relatively little attention to date, is spending behavior. In this paper, using the transaction records of 1306 bank customers, we investigated the extent to which individual-level psychological characteristics can be inferred from bank transaction data. Specifically, we developed a more comprehensive feature space using: (1) overall spending behavior (i.e. total number and total amount of transaction), (2) temporal spending behavior (i.e. variability, persistence, and burstiness), (3) category-related spending behavior (i.e. diversity, persistence, and turnover), (4) customer category profile, and (5) socio-demographic information. Using these features, we first explore their association with individual psychological characteristics, we then analyze the performances of the different feature families and finally, we try to understand to what extent psychological characteristics from spending records can be inferred. Our results show that inferring the psychological traits of an individual is a challenging task, even when using a comprehensive set of features that take temporal aspects of spending into account. We found that Materialism and Self-Control could be inferred with relatively high levels of accuracy, while the accuracy obtained for the Big Five traits was lower, with only Extraversion and Neuroticism reaching reasonable classification performances. Hence, for traits like Materialism, Self-control, Extraversion, and Neuroticism our findings could be used to improve psychologically-informed advertising strategies for specific products as well as personality-based spending management apps and credit scoring approaches.

<blockquote>
Digital contact tracing is a relevant tool to control infectious disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 epidemic. Early work evaluating digital contact tracing omitted important features and heterogeneities of real-world contact patterns influencing contagion dynamics. We fill this gap with a modeling framework informed by empirical high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread in real environments. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15–20 minutes and closer than 2–3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a low-delay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance. Finally, we observe the inefficacy of a less privacy-preserving tracing involving second order contacts. Our results may inform digital contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.

In this paper we analyze a greedy procedure to approximate a linear functional defined in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by nodal values. This procedure computes a quadrature rule which can be applied to general functionals. For a large class of functionals, that includes integration functionals and other interesting cases, but does not include differentiation, we prove convergence results for the approximation by means of quasi-uniform and greedy points which generalize in various ways several known results. A perturbation analysis of the weights and node computation is also discussed. Beyond the theoretical investigations, we demonstrate numerically that our algorithm is effective in treating various integration densities, and that it is even very competitive when compared to existing methods for Uncertainty Quantification.

<blockquote>
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) struggle to generate structured objects like molecules and game maps. The issue is that structured objects must satisfy hard requirements (eg, molecules must be chemically valid) that are difficult to acquire from examples alone. As a remedy, we propose Constrained Adversarial Networks (CANs), an extension of GANs in which the constraints are embedded into the model during training. This is achieved by penalizing the generator proportionally to the mass it allocates to invalid structures. In contrast to other generative models, CANs support efficient inference of valid structures (with high probability) and allows to turn on and off the learned constraints at inference time. CANs handle arbitrary logical constraints and leverage knowledge compilation techniques to efficiently evaluate the disagreement between the model and the constraints. Our setup is further extended to hybrid logical-neural constraints for capturing very complex constraints, like graph reachability. An extensive empirical analysis shows that CANs efficiently generate valid structures that are both high-quality and novel.

For certain dynamical systems it is possible to significantly simplify the study of stability by means of the center manifold theory. This theory allows to isolate the complicated asymptotic behavior of the system close to a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point, and to obtain meaningful predictions of its behavior by analyzing a reduced dimensional problem. Since the manifold is usually not known, approximation methods are of great interest to obtain qualitative estimates. In this work, we use a data-based greedy kernel method to construct a suitable approximation of the manifold close to the equilibrium. The data are collected by repeated numerical simulation of the full system by means of a high-accuracy solver, which generates sets of discrete trajectories that are then used to construct a surrogate model of the manifold. The method is tested on different examples which show promising performance and good accuracy.

<blockquote>
Crystal calorimeters have a long history of pushing the frontier on high-resolution electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry for photons and electrons. We explore in this paper major innovations in collider detector performance that can be achieved with crystal calorimetry when longitudinal segmentation and dual-readout capabilities are combined with a new high EM resolution approach to Particle Flow in multi-jet events, such as e+e+→ HZ events in all-hadronic final-states at Higgs factories. We demonstrate a new technique for pre-processing π0 momenta through combinatoric di-photon pairing in advance of applying jet algorithms. This procedure significantly reduces π0 photon splitting across jets in multi-jet events. The correct photon-to-jet assignment efficiency improves by a factor of about 3 when the EM resolution is improved from 15 to 3%/√E. In addition, the technique of bremsstrahlung photon recovery significantly improves electron momentum measurements. A high EM resolution calorimeter increases the Z boson recoil mass resolution in Higgstrahlung events for decays into electron pairs to 80% of that for muon pairs. We present the design and optimization of a highly segmented crystal detector concept that achieves the required energy resolution of 3%/√E, and a time resolution better than 30 ps providing exceptional particle identification capabilities. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous detector designs that suffered from large neutral hadron resolution degradation from one interaction length of crystals in front of a sampling hadron calorimeter, the implementation of dual-readout on crystals permits to achieve a resolution better than 30%/√E⊕ 2% for neutral hadrons. Our studies find that the integration of crystal calorimetry into future Higgs factory collider detectors can open new perspectives by yielding the highest level of combined EM and neutral hadron resolution in the PFA paradigm.

<blockquote>
 Urban planners, authorities, and numerous additional players have to deal with challenges related to the rapid urbanization process and its effect on human mobility and transport dynamics. Hence, optimize transportation systems represents a unique occasion for municipalities. Indeed, the quality of transport is linked to economic growth, and by decreasing traffic congestion, the life quality of the inhabitants is drastically enhanced. Most state-of-the-art solutions optimize traffic in specific and small zones of cities (e.g., single intersections) and cannot be used to gather insights for an entire city. Moreover, evaluating such optimized policies in a realistic way that is convincing for policy-makers can be extremely expensive. In our work, we propose a reinforcement learning frameworks to overtake these two limitations. In particular, we use human mobility data to optimize the transport dynamics of three real-world cities (i.e., Berlin, Santiago de Chile, Dakar) and a synthesized one (i.e., SynthTown). To this end, we transform the transportation dynamics' simulator MATSim into a realistic reinforcement learning environment able to optimize and evaluate transportation policies using agents that perform realistic daily activities and trips. In this way, we can assess transportation policies in a manner that is convincing for policy-makers. Finally, we develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates MATSim dynamics with a Partially Observable Discrete Event Decision Process (PODEDP) and, with respect to other state-of-art policy optimization techniques, can scale on big transportation data and find optimal policies also on a city-scale.

Using smartphone location data from Colombia, Mexico, and Indonesia, we investigate how non-pharmaceutical policy interventions intended to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic impact human mobility. In all three countries, we find that following the implementation of mobility restriction measures, human movement decreased substantially. Importantly, we also uncover large and persistent differences in mobility reduction between wealth groups: on average, users in the top decile of wealth reduced their mobility up to twice as much as users in the bottom decile. For decision-makers seeking to efficiently allocate resources to response efforts, these findings highlight that smartphone location data can be leveraged to tailor policies to the needs of specific socioeconomic groups, especially the most vulnerable.

"Code is law" is the funding principle of cryptocurrencies. The security, transferability, availability and other properties of a crypto-asset are determined by the code through which it is created. If code is open source, as it happens for most cryptocurrencies, this principle would prevent manipulations and grant transparency to users and traders. However, this approach considers cryptocurrencies as isolated entities thus neglecting possible connections between them. Here, we show that 4% of developers contribute to the code of more than one cryptocurrency and that the market reflects these cross-asset dependencies. In particular, we reveal that the first coding event linking two cryptocurrencies through a common developer leads to the synchronisation of their returns in the following months. Our results identify a clear link between the collaborative development of cryptocurrencies and their market behaviour. More broadly, our work reveals a so-far overlooked systemic dimension for the transparency of code-based ecosystems and we anticipate it will be of interest to researchers, investors and regulators.

<blockquote>
The steady growth of digitized historical information is continuously stimulating new different approaches to the fields of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science. In this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to retrieve large amounts of historical information from Wikipedia. In particular, the pages of a set of historically notable individuals are processed to catch the locations and the date of people’s movements. This information is then structured in a geographical network of mobility patterns. We analyze the mobility of historically notable individuals from different perspectives to better understand the role of migrations and international collaborations in the context of innovation and cultural development. In this work, we first present some general characteristics of the dataset from a social and geographical perspective. Then, we build a spatial network of cities, and we model and quantify the tendency to explore of a set of people that can be considered as historically and culturally notable. In this framework, we show that by using a multilevel radiation model for human mobility, we are able to catch important features of migration’s behavior. Results show that the choice of the target migration place for historically and culturally relevant people is limited to a small number of locations and that it depends on the discipline a notable is interested in and on the number of opportunities she/he can find there.

<blockquote>
We present a novel acceleration method for the solution of parametric ODEs by single-step implicit solvers by means of greedy kernel-based surrogate models. In an offline phase, a set of trajectories is precomputed with a high-accuracy ODE solver for a selected set of parameter samples, and used to train a kernel model which predicts the next point in the trajectory as a function of the last one. This model is cheap to evaluate, and it is used in an online phase for new parameter samples to provide a good initialization point for the nonlinear solver of the implicit integrator. The accuracy of the surrogate reflects into a reduction of the number of iterations until convergence of the solver, thus providing an overall speedup of the full simulation. Interestingly, in addition to providing an acceleration, the accuracy of the solution is maintained, since the ODE solver is still used to guarantee the required precision. Although the method can be applied to a large variety of solvers and different ODEs, we will present in details its use with the Implicit Euler method for the solution of the Burgers equation, which results to be a meaningful test case to demonstrate the method’s features.

<blockquote>
A variety of methods is available to quantify uncertainties arising within the modeling of flow and transport in carbon dioxide storage, but there is a lack of thorough comparisons. Usually, raw data from such storage sites can hardly be described by theoretical statistical distributions since only very limited data is available. Hence, exact information on distribution shapes for all uncertain parameters is very rare in realistic applications. We discuss and compare four different methods tested for data-driven uncertainty quantification based on a benchmark scenario of carbon dioxide storage. In the benchmark, for which we provide data and code, carbon dioxide is injected into a saline aquifer modeled by the nonlinear capillarity-free fractional flow formulation for two incompressible fluid phases, namely carbon dioxide and brine. To cover different aspects of uncertainty quantification, we incorporate various sources of uncertainty such as uncertainty of boundary conditions, of parameters in constitutive relations, and of material properties. We consider recent versions of the following non-intrusive and intrusive uncertainty quantification methods: arbitrary polynomial chaos, spatially adaptive sparse grids, kernel-based greedy interpolation, and hybrid stochastic Galerkin. The performance of each approach is demonstrated assessing expectation value and standard deviation of the carbon dioxide saturation against a reference statistic based on Monte Carlo sampling. We compare the convergence of all methods reporting on accuracy with respect to the number of model runs and resolution. Finally, we offer suggestions about the methods’ advantages and disadvantages that can guide the modeler for uncertainty quantification in carbon dioxide storage and beyond.

Access to financial institutions is difficult in developing economies and especially for the poor. However, the widespread adoption of mobile phones has enabled the development of mobile money systems that deliver financial services through the mobile phone network. Despite the success of mobile money, there is a lack of quantitative studies that unveil which factors contribute to the adoption and sustained usage of such services. In this paper, we describe the results of a quantitative study that analyzes data from the world's leading mobile money service, M-Pesa. We analyzed millions of anonymized mobile phone communications and M-Pesa transactions in an African country. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we analyze the customers' usage of M-Pesa and report large-scale patterns of behavior; (2) we present the results of applying machine learning models to predict mobile money adoption (AUC=0.691), and mobile money spending (AUC=0.619) using multiple data sources: mobile phone data, M-Pesa agent information, the number of M-Pesa friends in the userÕs social network, and the characterization of the userÕs geographic location; (3) we discuss the most predictive features in both models and draw key implications for the design of mobile money services in a developing country. We find that the most predictive features are related to mobile phone activity, to the presence of M-Pesa users in a customerÕs ego-network and to mobility. We believe that our work will contribute to the understanding of the factors playing a role in the adoption and sustained usage of mobile money services in developing economies.

<blockquote>
Modern simulation scenarios frequently require multi-query or real-time responses of simulation models for statistical analysis, optimization, or process control. However, the underlying simulation models may be very time-consuming rendering the simulation task difficult or infeasible. This motivates the need for rapidly computable surrogate models. We address the case of surrogate modeling of functions from vectorial input to vectorial output spaces. These appear, for instance, in simulation of coupled models or in the case of approximating general input–output maps. We review some recent methods and theoretical results in the field of greedy kernel approximation schemes. In particular, we recall the vectorial kernel orthogonal greedy algorithm (VKOGA) for approximating vector-valued functions. We collect some recent convergence statements that provide sound foundation for these algorithms, in particular quasi-optimal convergence rates in case of kernels inducing Sobolev spaces. We provide some initial experiments that can be obtained with non-symmetric greedy kernel approximation schemes. The results indicate better stability and overall more accurate models in situations where the input data locations are not equally distributed.

The availability of massive data-sets describing human mobility offers the possibility to design simulation tools to monitor and improve the resilience of transport systems in response to traumatic events such as natural and man-made disasters (e.g., floods, terrorist attacks, etc. . . ). In this perspective, we propose ACHILLES, an application to models people's movements in a given transport mode through a multiplex network representation based on mobility data. ACHILLES is a web-based application which provides an easy-to-use interface to explore the mobility fluxes and the connectivity of every urban zone in a city, as well as to visualize changes in the transport system resulting from the addition or removal of transport modes, urban zones, and single stops. Notably, our application allows the user to assess the overall resilience of the transport network by identifying its weakest node, i.e. Urban Achilles Heel, with reference to the ancient Greek mythology. To demonstrate the impact of ACHILLES for humanitarian aid we consider its application to a real-world scenario by exploring human mobility in Singapore in response to flood prevention.

In this paper we consider the problem of approximating vector-valued functions over a domain $\Omega$. For this purpose, we use matrix-valued reproducing kernels, which can be related to Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vectorial functions and which can be viewed as an extension of the scalar-valued case. These spaces seem promising, when modelling correlations between the target function components, as the components are not learned independently of each other. We focus on the interpolation with such matrix-valued kernels. We derive error bounds for the interpolation error in terms of a generalized power-function and we introduce a subclass of matrix-valued kernels whose power-functions can be traced back to the power-function of scalar-valued reproducing kernels. Finally, we apply these kind of kernels to some artificial data to illustrate the benefit of interpolation with matrix-valued kernels in comparison to a componentwise approach.

<blockquote>
In this work, we consider 2 kinds of model reduction techniques to simulate blood flow through the largest systemic arteries, where a stenosis is located in a peripheral artery, i.e., in an artery that is located far away from the heart. For our simulations, we place the stenosis in one of the tibial arteries belonging to the right lower leg (right posterior tibial artery). The model reduction techniques that are used are on the one hand dimensionally reduced models (1-D and 0-D models, the so-called mixed-dimension model) and on the other hand surrogate models produced by kernel methods. Both methods are combined in such a way that the mixed-dimension models yield training data for the surrogate model, where the surrogate model is parametrised by the degree of narrowing of the peripheral stenosis. By means of a well-trained surrogate model, we show that simulation data can be reproduced with a satisfactory accuracy and that parameter optimisation or state estimation problems can be solved in a very efficient way. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a surrogate model enables us to present after a very short simulation time the impact of a varying degree of stenosis on blood flow, obtaining a speedup of several orders over the full model.

<blockquote>
We propose a novel kernel-based method for image reconstruction from scattered Radon data. To this end, we employ generalized Hermite–Birkhoff interpola- tion by positive definite kernel functions. For radial kernels, however, a straightforward application of the generalized Hermite–Birkhoff interpolation method fails to work, as we prove in this paper. To obtain a well-posed reconstruction scheme for scattered Radon data, we introduce a new class of weighted positive definite kernels, which are symmetric but not radially symmetric. By our construction, the resulting weighted ker- nels are combinations of radial positive definite kernels and positive weight functions. This yields very flexible image reconstruction methods, which work for arbitrary dis- tributions of Radon lines. We develop suitable representations for the weighted basis functions and the symmetric positive definite kernel matrices that are resulting from the proposed reconstruction scheme. For the relevant special case, where Gaussian radial kernels are combined with Gaussian weights, explicit formulae for the weighted Gaus- sian basis functions and the kernel matrices are given. Supporting numerical examples are finally presented.

Kernel-based methods provide flexible and accurate algorithms for the reconstruction of functions frommeshless samples. A major question in the use of such methods is the influence of the samples’ locationson the behavior of the approximation, and feasible optimal strategies are not known for general problems.Nevertheless, efficient and greedy point-selection strategies are known. This paper gives a proof of theconvergence rate of the data-independentP-greedyalgorithm, based on the application of the convergencetheory for greedy algorithms in reduced basis methods. The resulting rate of convergence is shown to bequasi-optimal in the case of kernels generating Sobolev spaces.As a consequence, this convergence rate proves that, for kernels of Sobolev spaces, the points selected bythe algorithm are asymptotically uniformly distributed, as conjectured in the paper where the algorithmhas been introduced.

In this paper we propose a new stable and accurate approximation technique which is extremely effective for interpolating large scattered data sets. The Partition of Unity (PU) method is performed considering Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as local approximants and using locally supported weights. In particular, the approach consists in computing, for each PU subdomain, a stable basis. Such technique, taking advantage of the local scheme, leads to a significant benefit in terms of stability, especially for flat kernels. Furthermore, an optimized searching procedure is applied to build the local stable bases, thus rendering the method more efficient.

In the recent paper [1], a new method to compute stable kernel-based interpolants has been presented. This rescaled interpolation method combines the standard kernel interpolation with a properly defined rescaling operation, which smooths the oscillations of the interpolant. Although promising, this procedure lacks a systematic theoretical investigation. Through our analysis, this novel method can be understood as standard kernel interpolation by means of a properly rescaled kernel. This point of view allows us to consider its error and stability properties.

<blockquote>
Strong and supportive social relationships are fundamental to our well-being. However, there are costs to their maintenance, resulting in a trade-off between quality and quantity, a typical strategy being to put a lot of effort on a few high-intensity relationships while maintaining larger numbers of less close relationships. It has also been shown that there are persistent individual differences in this pattern; some individuals allocate their efforts more uniformly across their networks, while others strongly focus on their closest relationships. Furthermore, some individuals maintain more stable networks than others. Here, we focus on how personality traits of individuals affect this picture, using mobile phone calls records and survey data from the Mobile Territorial Lab (MTL) study. In particular, we look at the relationship between personality traits and the (i) persistence of social signatures, namely the similarity of the social signature shape of an individual measured in different time intervals; (ii) the turnover in egocentric networks, that is, differences in the set of alters present at two consecutive temporal intervals; and (iii) the rank dynamics defined as the variation of alter rankings in egocentric networks in consecutive intervals. We observe that some traits have effects on the stability of the social signatures as well as network turnover and rank dynamics. As an example, individuals who score highly in the Openness to Experience trait tend to have higher levels of network turnover and larger alter rank variations. On broader terms, our study shows that personality traits clearly affect the ways in which individuals maintain their personal networks.

<blockquote>
The exploration of peopleÕs everyday life has long been of interest to social scientists. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in analyzing human behavioral data generated by technology (e.g. mobile phones). To date, a few large-scale studies have been designed to measure human behaviors and interactions using multiple sources of data. A common characteristic of these studies is the population under investigation: students having similar daily routines and needs. This choice constraints the range of behaviors, of places and the generalization of the results. In order to widen this line of studies, we focus on a different target group: parents with young children aged 0 through 10 years. Children influence multiple aspects of their parentsÕ lives, from the satisfaction of basic human needs and the fulfillment of social roles to their financial status and sleep quality. In this paper, we describe the Mobile Territorial Lab (MTL) project, a longitudinal living lab which has been sensing by means of technology (mobile phones) the lives of more than 100 parents in different areas of the Trentino region in Northern Italy. We present the preliminary results after two years of experimentation of, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete picture of parentsÕ daily lives. Through the collection and analysis of the collected data, we created a multi-layered view of the participantsÕ lives, tracking social interactions, mobility routines, spending patterns, and personality characteristics. Overall, our results prove the relevance of living lab approaches to measure human behaviors and interactions, which can pave the way to new studies exploiting a richer number of behavioral indicators. Moreover, we believe that the proposed methodology and the collected data could be very valuable for researchers from different disciplines such as social psychology, sociology, computer science, economy, etc., which are interested in understanding human behaviour.

<blockquote>
Kernel-based methods in Numerical Analysis have the advantage of yielding optimal recovery processes in the “native” Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ in which they are reproducing. Continuous kernels on compact domains have an expansion into eigenfunctions that are both $L_2$-orthonormal and orthogonal in $\mathcal H$ (Mercer expansion). This paper examines the corresponding eigenspaces and proves that they have optimality properties among all other subspaces of $\mathcal H$. These results have strong connections to $n$-widths in Approximation Theory, and they establish that errors of optimal approximations are closely related to the decay of the eigenvalues. Though the eigenspaces and eigenvalues are not readily available, they can be well approximated using the standard $n$-dimensional subspaces spanned by translates of the kernel with respect to $n$ nodes or centers. We give error bounds for the numerical approximation of the eigensystem via such subspaces. A series of examples shows that our numerical technique via a greedy point selection strategy allows to calculate the eigensystems with good accuracy.

<blockquote>
In applied sciences it is often required to model and supervise temporal evolution of populations via dynamical systems. In this paper, we focus on the problem of approximating the basins of attraction of such models for each stable equilibrium point. We propose to reconstruct the basins via an implicit interpolant using stable radial bases, obtaining the surfaces by partitioning the phase space into disjoint regions. An application to a competition model presenting jointly three stable equilibria is considered.

<blockquote>
In recent years, in the setting of radial basis function, the study of approximation algorithms has particularly focused on the construction of (stable) bases for the associated Hilbert spaces. One of the ways of describing such spaces and their properties is the study of a particular integral operator and its spectrum. We proposed in a recent work the so-called WSVD basis, which is strictly connected to the eigen-decomposition of this operator and allows to overcome some problems related to the stability of the computation of the approximant for a wide class of radial kernels. Although effective, this basis is computationally expensive to compute. In this paper we discuss a method to improve and compute in a fast way the basis using methods related to Krylov subspaces. After reviewing the connections between the two bases, we concentrate on the properties of the new one, describing its behavior by numerical tests.

<blockquote>
It is well-known that radial basis function interpolants suffer of bad conditioning if the basis of translates is used. In the recent work [5], the authors gave a quite general way to build stable and orthonormal bases for the native space ${\mathcal{N}_{\Phi}(\Omega)}$ associated to a  kernel $\Phi$ on a domain  $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^s$. The method is simply based on the factorization of the corresponding kernel matrix.  \\Starting from that setting we describe a particular basis which turns out to be orthonormal in ${\mathcal{N}_{\Phi}(\Omega)}$  and in $\ell_{2,w}(X)$, where $X$ is a set of data sites of the domain $\Omega$. The basis arises from a weighted singular value decomposition of the kernel matrix. This  basis is also related to a discretization of the compact operator $T_{\Phi}: {\mathcal{N}_{\Phi}(\Omega)}\rightarrow{\mathcal{N}_{\Phi}(\Omega)}$,  $$T_{\Phi}[f](x) = \int_{\Omega} \Phi(x,y) f(y) dy\quad \forall x\in\Omega$$ and provides a connection with the continuous basis that arises from an  eigen-decomposition of $T_{\Phi}$.  Finally, using the eigenvalues of this operator,  we provide convergence estimates and stability bounds for interpolation and discrete least-squares approximation.

We implement in Matlab a Gauss-like cubature formula on bivariate domains whose boundary is a piecewise smooth Jordan curve (curvilinear polygons). The key tools are Green’s integral formula, together with the recent software package Chebfun to approximate the boundary curve close to machine precision by piecewise Chebyshev interpolation. Several tests are presented, including some comparisons of this new routine ChebfunGauss with the recent SplineGauss that approximates the boundary by splines.
